# Deciding project and tool
##### 11/8/22

### Project Overview: 
The inspiration for this game is from my first few months going into weight lifting, where I had done many that could have been better. Some of these have been helpful and some have been doing the opposite. Since many people start fitness doing things to the extreme or too little, many don't see any improvements. Therefore I want to create a simulator of a random person with random weight, random fat % and random metabolism, etc. These random factors will be the main contributors to the game experience, where the user has to figure out plans for the person based on their stats. With correct sequences of actions the player can experience the joy of improving and learn the correct ways to exercise safely on the side. 

The Player will start the game choosing a difficulty level, different difficulty levels will have different range 
of stats, and information. 
* An easy mode player can see their current metabolism/determination.
* A Normal mode player will have hidden metabolism/determination values. 
* A hard mode player will have hidden metabolism/determination along with a worser range of beginning stats. 

After choosing the type of mode, the character will be brought to the first day and the main control interface, where the player can inspect their basic stats, and create a plan for the day, such as a diet and workout to do. After the character is done planning they can end the day. The system will calculate in the background the increases and decreases of each stat based on the actions. 
On the next day, the system will display the characterâ€™s current feeling, such as dizzy, hungry, tired, etc. And the character will cycle through the planning phase again. 

### Tools : Unity
The tool I will be using is unity, a popular game engine for 2D and 3D game editing. The reason for choosing this editor is because of the popularity and the amount of sources/documation that has been created based on Unity, therefore it will be easy to learn from multiple different sources. Expectually Unity doesn't do major updates, which tutorials from many years back can still be relevant. Unity also brings an easy to use and simple interface that can be easily navigated. 

### EDP
I am currently in the engineering design process step 1 and 2, where I define what I want to create and use. After the defining of the project topic, I will be learning to use Unity in step 2 where I do research on the project. 

### Skills 
In the process of this project I look forward to improving my debugging and organization skills. Being organized in unity can be done by using different folders for different elements such as sprites folder. Being able to debug is also important to note as it is my first contact with unity, many issues are bound to occur but these issues are also the building blocks to learning.
