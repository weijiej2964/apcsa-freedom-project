# Tool Tinkering
##### 12/12/2022

### Context

In the following weeks of tinkering with Unity, I have got a basic understanding of the functionailty of the engine. I organized my goals for the project and focused on learning a few key features. For example, the main function of changing text using code so each passing day can result in a change in the player statics. Also opening and closing certain user interfaces that is going to play a role in opening and closing the player stat interface. In addition I learned button `onClick ` events so that the player can interact with the the game. 

### Click Event

Clicking event is the main way the player is going to interact with the game's functions, such as transitions, opening panels, etc. Therefore it is the first feature I dug into. The video I watched was (Master Unity Button OnClick actions)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky-bzQFxV2U&t=522s&ab_channel=CocoCode] by Coco Code, which go through `TextMeshPro`'s UI functionality. TextMeshPro Button UI is a precreated object element with the `button` compoent and a text element inside the object. TextMeshPro button UI is extermely useful and provides the foudation of a button, so all I need to do is code the functionality script and attach to the button's `button` compoent.
