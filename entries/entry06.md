# Entry 6
##### 5/30/23

### Context (Expo)

After completing the minimum viable product for our weight lifting simulator, we begin preparing our elevator pitches for the following expo. The elevator pitch or the preparation I did for the expo consists of an introduction and 10 of the most important aspects of the project. My top 10 main points for the project are as follows, with 1 being the most important. 

7) You can plan the Diet
8) You can plan the Exercise 
2) Player gain muscle and fat during calorie surplus
3) Player lose muscle and fat during calorie deficit 
4) The ratio of gain and loss can be positively improved with exercise. 
9) Player’s mood will affect the stats of the player
10) Random events will appear every week, affecting the character stats. 
5) Player’s metabolism is affected by the diet 
6) Player’s determination affects the events negatively. 
1) Player loses upon reaching zero determination, aka relapse. 

### Expo 

During the expo, judges approach different tables and the presenters give their elevator pitch and give a demo of the project. As the judges approached my table, and getting ready to give my elevator pitch, I realized that I had forgotten many parts of my pitch from the pressuring atmosphere. Luckily however, I was able to piece my pitch back together by remembering to talk about the main points above. 

After successfully giving my pitch, I had to give the demo when simmer.io became unresponsive. It is at this point, I remembered that I still have a video for a backup plan. I opened the video and played it while stopping once in a while to give a brief explanation of what was happening. 

As I played and stopped and skipped some parts, the video came to an end and I was able to conclude my project demo with praise for my own project. 

### Context (Presentation) 

Aside from the expo, everyone also has a presentation to present to the other APCSA students. I in this scenario decide to create my slides in a way that is both comedic and motivational because at the end of the day, the point of the project is to get people moving. 

At this time, we focused on putting all the main points and details into the project as well and the hook and conclusion. We kept our project slides very clean and avoided walls of text and it turned out very cool. 

### Presentation 

While showing the amazingly designed intro screen, we had our partner Anson give a quick greeting and intro. Starting with the hook, I wasn't sure if it was sufficient enough to keep people engaged but In reality it turned out great and for the most part, it was going smoothly, on the surface. As we progressed, I realized that although we don't have blocks of text and it is very clean and good looking, because I had to talk off the top of my head, I stuttered a lot. As I think of how I should have just paused once in a while, the presentation comes to an end. I gave my little motivation, inspirational, innovational, revolutional speech to give my classmates a shot of adrenaline and thanked them for their time. 

Although most of the time in the presentation it was all chill and fun, I do hope people understand that although starting something new is hard, but if they persisted, they could live a healthier life and be more confident everyday.
