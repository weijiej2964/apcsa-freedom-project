# APCSA Freedom Project
by Weijie Jiang

## Context
This “Freedom Project” for APCSA is all about Weight Training, I wanted to give people a basic understanding of fitness and weight training. A lot of people when starting like to push themselves to the extreme and end up failing because of it. I created this game to show people that pushing themselves too hard would likely end up relapsing because of the pressure they put on their determination. 

## Content

## Implications

My initial incentive was to create a project to help people benefit their social and personal lifes. 

During the creation, I intentionally added determination as the major factor so people can understand the dangers of pushing themselves too much. I can say that it does not benefit individuals in any way. In the real world I see many girls, including sister, like to starve themselves to get "skinny" and over the years, she not only failed every time but also did damage to her own physical well being. So does a lot of boys who does a bunch of exercise trying to push themselves to the limit, including myself. However, by pushing this hard to start instead of building a habit, they get burned out quickly. Neither of these two are what I want to see so I want to create a game that emphasizes the importance of progressive overloading and balanced dieting.
